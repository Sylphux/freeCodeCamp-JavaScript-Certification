# What is this repo

freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification. I will post here all the exercices as I do them.
I might not post all the small exercices but will post all labs and bigger exercices.

# Credits

This project started as a peer learning project with @Jiwoki-code but I decided to continue alone because of time constraints. This originally was a fork of the original project on which I'm continuing the adventure. I turned the fork into a standalone repo to see the commits history on my profile page.
